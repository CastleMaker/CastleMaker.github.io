# Hobbies


## Documentray
I have a keen interest in watching documentaries, as they offer a fascinating glimpse into various aspects of the world. Recently, I have been particularly captivated by "Clarkson's Farm." This engaging series follows Jeremy Clarkson as he embarks on the challenging journey of managing his own farm. Watching documentaries like this allows me to broaden my knowledge and gain new perspectives on different subjects.

## Hiking
I enjoy hiking in forests and hills. Exploring the great outdoors provides me with a sense of adventure and tranquility. Recently, I went hiking in Dartmoor, near Exeter. The stunning landscapes and rugged terrain of Dartmoor offer a perfect escape from the hustle and bustle of daily life. Each hike presents a new opportunity to discover the natural beauty of the area and challenge myself physically.

## Gym
Recently, I have started to embrace fitness, focusing on powerlifting. I am dedicated to my training routine, going to the gym on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. Powerlifting has become a new passion for me, as it not only improves my physical strength but also enhances my mental resilience and discipline.

## Video Games
Occasionally, I also indulge in playing video games during my free time. Some of my favorite games include Zelda, Stardew Valley, and FC (Football Club). These games offer a wonderful mix of adventure, creativity, and strategy, providing a fun and relaxing way to unwind.
