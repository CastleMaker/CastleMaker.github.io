# About Me

<img src="/images/xf.jpg" class="floatpic" width="360" height="480">

Here is **Xianbang Feng (冯宪邦)**.

I am currently a PhD candidate at [Geography, University of Exeter](https://geography.exeter.ac.uk/) and doing fieldwork at the Birmingham Institute of Forest Research, [BIFoR](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/bifor). My PhD project is about the response of mycorrhiza to climate change and its influence on essential ecosystem functions like litter decomposition, which is supervised by [Prof Iain Hartley](https://www.exeter.ac.uk/research/esi/people/profile/index.php?web_id=Iain_Hartley) about experiments and [Prof Lina Mercado](https://geography.exeter.ac.uk/people/profile/index.php?web_id=Lina_Mercado) in terms of modelling. 

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I would love to chat and collaborate, please email me at - *xf258@exeter.ac.uk*

## Research Interests
- Environmental Ecology
- Mycorrhizal Fungi
- Carbon and Nutrient Cycling
- Terrestrial Ecosystem

My research interests lie in the intersection of soil ecology and ecosystem processes, particularly focusing on the role of mycorrhizal fungi in leaf litter decomposition and how it respones to climate changes. I am conducting fieldwork to explore how these symbiotic relationships influence nutrient cycling and organic matter breakdown in natural environments. Additionally, I am preparing a meta-analysis to synthesize existing literature on this topic, aiming to draw broader ecological conclusions. I am also keen on integrating machine learning and modeling techniques to enhance the analysis and interpretation of complex ecological data, thereby advancing our understanding of these critical environmental interactions.
