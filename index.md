# About Me

<img src="/images/xf.jpg" class="floatpic" width="360" height="480">

Here is **Xianbang Feng (冯宪邦)**.

I am currently a PhD candidate at [Geography, University of Exeter](https://geography.exeter.ac.uk/) and doing fieldwork at the Birmingham Institute of Forest Research, [BIFoR](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/bifor). My PhD project is about the response of mycorrhiza to climate change and its influence on essential ecosystem functions. Supervised by [Prof Iain Hartley](https://www.exeter.ac.uk/research/esi/people/profile/index.php?web_id=Iain_Hartley) and [Prof Lina Mercado](https://geography.exeter.ac.uk/people/profile/index.php?web_id=Lina_Mercado). 

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I would love to chat and collaborate, please email me at - *xf258[at]exeter[dot]ac.uk*
